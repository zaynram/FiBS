      <h3 style="color: purple"> OVERVIEW </h3>
        <p tag="factual">
          Compass Pathways is "a biotechnology company dedicated to accelerating patient access to evidence-based innovation in mental health" and is currently "pioneering the development of a [...] proprietary formulation of synthetic psilocybin [...] administered in conjunction with psychological support". 
          
          Today they announced their third quarter financial results and business updates for this year, and they state they have begun phase 3 clinical trials. They expect the first data release for their studies to take place in Q2 2025, and the following one in Q3/4 2026. As far as my research has shown, they are the first in the field to reach phase 3, and this puts them in prime position to make it to market ahead of the curve. Another point to strenghten them as a prospect is that they have enough capital to provide runway through 2026, which is important given how tumultuous pursuits of this nature can be.
          
          That brings me to my next point; there are decently hefty risks involved in such an investment as a means to not overinflate the proposed potential of such an investment. Firstly, if they do not secure the necessary funding to run operations and repay their loan in full when it is called, "clinical trials have the potential to be delayed, limited, or terminated overall". Long term success is also dependent on approval from several regulatory bodies regarding various aspects of their market approach and product. Additionally, clinical trials always include various elements of unpredictability as proposed projections can only control for so many factors. 
        </p>
      <h3 style="color: blue"> SIDE NOTE ON RISK </h3>
        <p tag="subjective"> 
          In my opinion, this is basically why clinical trials exist; extremeley rigorous quality assessment for health security. Therefore, this is less of a personal risk consideration because I align myself with the frameworks and research supporting this as a safe and effective treatment.
        </p> 
      <h3 style="color: green"> PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCES BASE </h3>
        <p tag="pseudo-factual"> 
          In my neuro psycho pharmacology class, a large emphasis was placed on (ketamine, and) the 2018/2019 FDA approval of psilocybin as a treatment for a set of Major Depressive Disorders. This had a huge impact on the community outlook on depressive disorders, as it focussed and prompted investor funding of R&D for treatment-focused applications of psilocybin. This was the first stage in the process that medicinal corporations take in developing their commercial version; it was basically the genesis of tangible potential for psilocybin treatments. Companies were already aware of the theoretical potential of the substance through prior research that yielded promising results in rodents. 
        </p> 
      <h3 style="color: orange"> PREDICTIONS RE ABOVE</h3>  
        <p tag="unverified"> 
          In addition, consider that SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) are the most widely prescribed antidepressant. Psychology researchers, even my professor, generally align themselves with the fact that a serotonin deficit is not the root cause of depressive disorders. It is an unquestionable attribute of depression, but <b tag="sub"> it was only assigned blame due to confirmation bias. </b> It is physically impossible to measure serotonin levels in a living person. When SSRIs first hit the market people were very excited that patients reported positive effects, and this information in combination with an inability to confirm pushed researchers to make the golden mistake. They assigned causation to the correlation when in reality, SSRIs tend to merely have a global dampening effect on mood/affect overall. While this can reduce suicidal ideations in individuals with severe depression, it has the potential to make patient symptoms even worse. 
        </p>
      <h3 style="color: pink"> CLOSING </h3>
        <p tag="subjective">
          It is a personal theory that treatment-resistant depressive disorder is a fabrication stemming from the blind faith placed in SSRIs over the years. This is evidence towards the idea that developing novel pharmaceutical solutions for treating depression seems like a heavy demanded, highly lucrative market, and this specific one is backed by my own research and personal inclinations.
